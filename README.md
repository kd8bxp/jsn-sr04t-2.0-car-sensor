# Idea for a blind spot detector, or a how close is the car behind you

## Libraries

Because the Arduino IDE has been getting pretty bad handling libraries, I've included the libraries used in the src directory of the sketch. These libraries may have been slightly modified to work from the sketch directory, and do not include the examples.  

## Installation

Other things used in this project, WS2812 Neopixel Ring (16 pixels)  
Active pizzo buzzer, and a photo resistor breakout board (a photo resistor setup as a voltage devider would work as well.)  
A micro-controller, Arduino UNO is what I used, any should work.  
Required Libraries:  
SoftwareSerial  should be in the library manager of the Arduino IDE.  
(only needed if you use serial mode2 of the sensor).  
Adafruit Neopixel - should be in the library manager  
TimedAction - I'm not sure where I got this library from.

## Things To Do


## Usage

Mode 1 - uses the echo/trig pins like a standard ultrasonic, I found this mode  
to be unstable at best, thou adding some averaging did seem to help.  
Use the jsn-sr04t-car_sensor sketch.  

Mode 2 - uses software serial, seems to be a little more stable, but still needed to have averaging applied.  
The hookup for the sensor/other componets is the same, if you wish to use mode 2  
you need a 47k resistor soldered to jumper R27.
